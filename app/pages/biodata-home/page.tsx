// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// BioData SA public marketing home page - rebuilt directly against the real
// Figma frame the user supplied (node 155:168, "Version 3"):
// https://www.figma.com/design/u4FTv88XXfy58MiLN5T5Wu/Home---Landing-Page?node-id=155-168
// Per CONTEXT.md's "Figma is the source of truth" contract, every section
// below was re-audited against that frame's actual `get_design_context`
// output (not the first pass's guess from pasted copy alone) - colours,
// copy groupings, section boundaries, and real exported photography/icon
// choices all come from the frame itself, not from re-guessing the earlier
// plain-text dump. Corrections this pass made against the first build:
// - The "Where to next" featured card is "Learn what is BioData SA"
//   (compass-03 icon), not "Explore" - the 2x2 grid beside it holds
//   Explore/Dashboard and Reporting/Contribute Data/Knowledge Centre.
// - The Flora/Fauna/Fungi & Other breakdown is 3 horizontal progress bars
//   next to the growth chart, not a pie/donut - there is no pie in this
//   frame at all.
// - "Researchers/Citizen Scientists/Field Surveys" are 3 static icon+label
//   badges (no switching), not a `Tabs` control - paired with a real
//   photo and the Contribute copy in one dark, gradient-backed section.
// - Explore's right column is 2 real overlapping product-screenshot mockups
//   (downloaded assets), not an icon illustration.
// - The Growth+Dashboard section is solid black, and its 4 stat tiles have
//   no card border/background - they float directly on black, unlike every
//   other stat tile on this page.
// - Every real photo/illustration (hero background, About's background,
//   the Contribute/personas photo, the Knowledge Centre photo, the Explore
//   mockups, the Acknowledgement of Country artwork, the floating cube/
//   treehouse decorations) is a real asset exported from the frame and
//   committed under `public/pages/biodata-home/`, per the design-to-code
//   skill's "never fabricate an image, download the real one" rule - none
//   of it is stock photography chosen after the fact.
// - The hero's stacked "Discover / South Australia's / Biodiversity /
//   Knowledge" wordmark uses Fredoka (Google Font), same as the frame -
//   loaded locally to this page only, since every other DEW/Scaffold
//   surface stays Geist/Barlow (see CONTEXT.md's "Geist stays Geist,
//   Barlow stays Barlow" rule - this is a third, page-scoped exception for
//   one decorative marketing headline, not a sitewide font change). The
//   frame hand-positions each word at its own size/offset for a fixed
//   1728px canvas; that's adapted here into a responsive stacked heading
//   with the same relative size hierarchy rather than pixel-cloned offsets,
//   since absolute per-word positioning doesn't survive a real viewport.
// - Obvious source typos are corrected, not transcribed: "Kinddoms" ->
//   "Kingdoms", "Dat Contributors" -> "Data Contributors". Every em/en-dash
//   in the copy is a plain hyphen per the no-em-dash rule.
// - The primary nav/header does have a real equivalent in the frame (a
//   header row above the hero, logo/wordmark + the same 6 nav links +
//   Login/Contribute Data) - confirmed visually via a full-frame render,
//   which the first pass's node-tree search missed. It already matches
//   closely enough (same links, same white bar) that no further pixel
//   audit was needed this pass.
// - Small decorative-only elements with no content meaning (the scroll-cue
//   chevrons, background blob/wave vectors, a partner-logo strip image
//   whose real logos aren't known) are left out rather than approximated -
//   same "a plain decorative layer doesn't need reproducing" allowance as
//   a Figma designer's note layer.
//
// Corrective pass (20-point user annotation review against the live page):
// - The "treehouse" decoration (node 155:178, a pale circle with a
//   branching leaf/coral silhouette) was wrongly scaled down and pinned to
//   the hero's own bottom-right corner, where it visually collided with the
//   4th stat card. Figma's real coordinates (x=1080-1967, y=969-1856 of the
//   1728px canvas) place it bleeding from the hero into the persona
//   statement section below - moved there as that section's missing
//   background line art, and removed from the hero.
// - Hero stat row switched `flex-wrap` -> `flex-nowrap` (+ `overflow-x-auto`
//   fallback) - node 155:198 is a fixed, non-wrapping 1336px/4-card row in
//   Figma, never a 2-line wrap.
// - Persona-statement paragraph (node 155:310) hard-wrapped to the real
//   4 lines Figma renders, instead of one reflowing paragraph.
// - "Where to next" 2x2 grid: row gap is 64px (`--spacing-7xl`), column gap
//   is 40px (`--spacing-5xl`) - two different tokens, not one uniform
//   `gap-10`. Featured card's gradient stops corrected to the frame's real
//   34% / 81.3% / 133.7%. Compass icon's stroke thinned (`strokeWidth={0.8}`)
//   to match the real exported asset's ~4px weight at this size, instead of
//   `@untitledui/icons`' default (which scales to ~10px here).
// - About section's darkening overlay opacities bumped up slightly per
//   direct feedback that it read too light against the frame.
// - Explore mockups enlarged and shifted to bleed down to the section's own
//   bottom edge, matching how far they extend in the frame.
// - Contribute column spacing corrected against node 155:264/155:280/
//   155:284: persona icons 48px apart (was 32px), the divider 20px below
//   the personas and 20px above the heading (was 48px both sides), and the
//   heading block 32px above the body paragraph (was flattened to the same
//   16px as the eyebrow-to-heading gap).
// - Acknowledgement of Country heading bumped to `text-3xl` to match every
//   other section H2 on this page.
// - Verified as already correct and left unchanged: the hero search bar
//   (node 155:193 matches the real `Input`/`Button` usage here almost
//   exactly), the sticky header's white background and 38px logo height,
//   the Contribute section's photo (already the real, flush-left asset),
//   and the two Contribute CTA buttons (node 155:303 confirms Figma's real
//   design does have "Learn how to Contribute" + "Contribute Data" here,
//   contradicting one piece of feedback asking to remove them - kept as
//   both a source-of-truth match and a user-facing note, not silently
//   overridden either way).
//
// Further corrective pass, per direct feedback:
// - The "treehouse" decoration (node 155:178) is removed outright - tried in the hero, then moved
//   to the persona-statement section, neither placement was wanted. Not re-added a third time.
// - The "Where to next" featured card and the Personas+Contribute section both switch their
//   background from the frame's own gradient (#4a8c8c -> #0d576e) to a flat `bg-brand-solid`
//   (brand-600, DEW's real "marine teal" token) - an explicit, deliberate divergence from the
//   literal Figma export in favour of design-system consistency, not a fidelity regression.
// - Acknowledgement of Country re-checked directly against node 15:3227 (the same section, also
//   present unchanged in "Version 2" of the frame): the gap between the photo and text column is
//   80px (`gap-[80px]`), not the 32px this had, and the gap between the heading and paragraph
//   inside the text column is 32px, not 16px.
// - Acknowledgement of Country's photo/text split was badly broken, not just mis-spaced: putting
//   `aspect-[1536/864]` directly on a `flex-1` <img> broke the browser's flex-basis:0% resolution
//   for that replaced element, so the image rendered at ~90% of the row width and pushed the text
//   column almost entirely outside the visible container. Fixed with the wrapper-div pattern
//   already used for every other aspect-ratio image on this page (`aspect-[...] flex-1` on a plain
//   div, the real `<img>` absolutely filling it) - verified via `getBoundingClientRect` that the
//   photo and text now split the row exactly 50/50, matching the frame's two `flex-[1_0_0]` halves.
//
// Content/IA round, per direct feedback (not a Figma-fidelity pass - several of these are
// deliberate departures from the frame):
// - "Knowledge Centre" renamed to "Resources & User Guides" - only the header nav label and the
//   section's own eyebrow (its H2 "Learn, apply and share.", its "Where to next" grid tile name,
//   and the footer's "Knowledge Centre" link were left alone since feedback didn't flag them).
// - The "References"/"Training resource" utility buttons next to "Browse knowledge base" are
//   removed (the "References" *tile* in the 8-tile grid is unrelated and stays).
// - Every checklist item on the page (About/Explore/Contribute, and the Knowledge Centre grid)
//   gets its own topic-relevant icon instead of the frame's repeated check-circle/layers-three-02 -
//   `CheckBadge`/`FeatureRow` now take an `icon` prop per item instead of a single hardcoded one.
// - A 9th Knowledge Centre tile, "Biodiversity Act" (not in the frame), added per direct feedback -
//   its description stays deliberately general rather than asserting specific legislative
//   provisions this build has no way to verify.
// - About section's height increased ~10% (`py-16 md:py-24` -> `py-[70px] md:py-[106px]`).
// - Explore, Contribute, and Knowledge Centre's internal vertical spacing re-audited directly
//   against `get_design_context` (not metadata, not assumption) and corrected to the frame's real
//   nested gap values - each section had at least one flattened gap where Figma nests two
//   different spacing tokens (e.g. Explore's eyebrow-to-heading is 16px but heading-block-to-
//   feature-list is 32px; both had been collapsed into one uniform gap). Explore's own section
//   padding also went from 96px to the frame's real 160px, matching the Acknowledgement/Knowledge
//   Centre sections' own 160px already fixed in an earlier round.
// - Contribute's two CTAs ("Learn how to Contribute", "Contribute Data") switched from filled
//   `Button`s to plain text links (matching the "Learn More" link already used on the featured
//   "Where to next" card) per direct feedback - "Contribute Data" also renamed to "Contribute Now"
//   and lost its leading upload icon to match the other link's trailing-arrow-only style. This
//   directly contradicts this file's own earlier note that node 155:303 confirms Figma's real
//   button styling here - a deliberate, explicit divergence from the frame, same category of
//   override as the flat `bg-brand-solid` backgrounds above, not a fidelity regression.
// - The black Growth+Dashboard section was a meaningfully different structure from node 155:566,
//   not just mis-spaced - re-audited per direct feedback ("match exactly like the figma layout").
//   The frame is a single vertical stack: the chart+percentage-bars block spans the full width on
//   top, and *below* it (not beside it) a second row holds the 4 stat tiles on the left and the
//   "Insights..." text block on the right. The first build put the stat tiles in their own
//   full-width row below everything and the text block beside the chart in a two-column layout -
//   both wrong relative to the frame's actual two-row structure.
// - Knowledge Centre's left column/tile grid switched from bottom-aligned to top-aligned
//   (`lg:items-start`, not `lg:items-end`) and the left column widened (`1.3fr` vs the tile grid's
//   `1fr` - the frame's own tile grid is a fixed ~656px, the left column takes the rest, wider than
//   the roughly-even split this had) so the photo renders larger, both per direct feedback.
// - Partial reversal, per direct feedback: "Contribute Now" switches back from a plain text link
//   to a real `secondary` Button (its immediate neighbour, "Learn how to Contribute", stays a text
//   link - only "Contribute Now" was asked to change back). Header nav's "Contribute Data" label
//   shortened to "Contribute" (the section eyebrow, the "Where to next" grid tile title, and the
//   header's own primary "Contribute Data" button were not flagged and stay as they are).
// - Two of this round's four items ("Contribute Now" as a secondary Button, header nav's
//   "Contribute" label) were exact re-reports of the previous round's fixes - verified both were
//   still correctly applied rather than assuming stale feedback, same as earlier re-reports on this
//   page. The other two were real: Knowledge Centre's "Browse knowledge base" button is removed
//   (the left column now ends with the photo), and its two columns are equal width
//   (`lg:grid-cols-2`, replacing the previous round's wider-left-column `1.3fr/1fr` split) per
//   direct feedback.
// - A new bottom section added per direct request: node 15:3517 (also 155:487 in "Version 3"), a
//   real SA Government legal/compliance footer strip (Disclaimer/Privacy/Accessibility links, the
//   Creative Commons licence line, the copyright notice, and the SA.GOV.AU/White Ribbon Workplace/
//   Green Building Council Australia/Reconciliation SA partner marks). Downloaded and committed as
//   a real exported asset rather than redrawn - these are real organisation marks, not decoration.
//   Sits below the site's own footer, on the frame's own `#0d576e` background (brand-700), distinct
//   from the footer's gray-900.
// - The site's own 4-column footer (`Biodata SA`/Explore/Contribute/Resources, `footerColumns`/
//   `footerLinkHrefs`) is removed outright per direct feedback - the government legal/compliance
//   strip above is now the last thing on the page. `id="site-footer"` moved onto that strip so the
//   header nav's "Contact Us" anchor still lands somewhere real.
// - The Explore section's two separate mockup screenshots (with their own hand-added border/
//   shadow treatment) are replaced with a single user-supplied composite image
//   (`explore-mockup-combined.png`, already includes its own shadow/frame styling) per direct
//   request - rendered plainly (`w-full`, no added border/shadow/positioning) since the image is
//   self-contained. The two old assets are deleted, not just unreferenced.
// - Header's primary CTA button renamed "Contribute Data" -> "Explore", and its target updated to
//   match (`#explore`, not `#contribute`) - the header nav's separate "Contribute"/"Explore" text
//   links are untouched, only this one button.
// - The "remove this [footer] section" feedback in this round was an exact re-report of a fix
//   already applied and verified live in the previous round - re-confirmed rather than re-applied.
// - The "Where to next" grid tile that duplicated "Knowledge Centre"/"Visit Knowledge Centre"
//   (title + CTA, `whereToNextGrid`) is renamed to "Resources & User Guides" per direct feedback -
//   this extends the earlier nav-label-only rename (see the "Knowledge Centre" comment above
//   `NAV_LINKS`) to this second, previously-missed spot. The main Knowledge Centre section's own
//   H2 and the footer's "Knowledge Centre" link are still untouched, unflagged so far. The same
//   round's "remove this [footer] section" item was, again, an exact re-report of an already-
//   applied removal - re-confirmed, not re-applied, same as the previous round.
